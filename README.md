# 🕋 Intelligent System for Hajj and Umrah Crowd Management

An end-to-end Big Data analytics project designed to optimize pilgrim safety and ritual efficiency using a dataset of 10,000 records.

## 🚀 The "Wow" Factor: 4 Levels of Analytics
This project goes beyond simple charts by implementing the full data science spectrum required for advanced Big Data Analytics:

* **Predictive**: Forecasts **Crowd Density** using Random Forest models.
* **Diagnostic**: Pinpoints the **root causes of stress** (it's personal space, not just the heat!).
* **Causal**: Statistically measures the impact of **AR Navigation** on ritual completion times.
* **Prescriptive**: A logic engine that **recommends transport** based on live weather safety constraints.

## 🛠️ Built With
This project leverages the standard Python data science stack:

* **Language**: Python 3.x
* **Data Wrangling**: Pandas & NumPy
* **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, Feature Importance)
* **Statistical Testing**: SciPy (T-Tests for Causal Analysis)
* **Visualization**: Matplotlib & Seaborn

---

## 🧠 Technical Highlights
* **Robust Preprocessing**: Processed 10,000 rows using **Min-Max Scaling** and **One-Hot Encoding** to ensure model fairness and accuracy.
* **Feature Engineering**: Extracted temporal features like **Hour of Day** to track the "pulse" of crowd movement.
* **Defensive Coding**: Implemented checks for missing columns and data types to ensure the notebook is reproducible and error-free.

## 📈 Key Findings
1.  **Stress Drivers**: Physical distance and movement speed are the primary factors affecting pilgrim stress.
2.  **Transport Logic**: Walking is fastest in high density, but the system prescribes **Train** during rain to prioritize safety.
3.  **Efficiency**: Current AR technology shows a neutral impact on ritual speed, suggesting rituals maintain a traditional pace.
